README

This program implements a command-line based user interface that controls git.
By using various menus the user should be able to perform the following tasks:

  1) List the current configuration settings of the repository.
  2) Allow you to change the current configurations of the repository (although
  outside of your name and e-mail, I'm not sure what else the user would want
  to change).
  3) List the commits and branches of the the repository (currently unable to
  list the branches, so only the commits are listed.)

I have been giving the hci and gitpp header files and have been advised to
used the functionality implemented by these header files.
