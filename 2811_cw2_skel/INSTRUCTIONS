This howto explains how to create a hello world submission. An example
submission is enclosed, see below for instructions how to inspect it.

== Prepare

1) create a directory

$ mkdir directory-name

2) change into it

$ cd directory-name

now create and edit the files, such as

$ $EDITOR example.cc
[..]
$ $EDITOR Makefile
[..]
$ $EDITOR README
[..]

== Create a git repository

make sure you are in the directory containing your files.

$ pwd
[..]/directory-name
$ ls
example.cc  Makefile  README

initialise a git repository, add the relevant files (and only those).

$ git init
$ git add example.cc Makefile README
$ git commit -m "initial commit for my coursework"

have a look what you just did

$ git log
[..]
$ git show
[..]

Now is the time to finish your exercise. you may edit your files, and do more
commits. you may optionally upload your data to other places, such as gitlab --
this is not mandatory. Make sure that eventually, all source files are
tracked and commited to your repository. Do not add/commit generated files or
binary files.

$ git commit -a
[..]
$ git ls-files # double check!
example.cc Makefile README [..]

== Finish the submission

Please make sure your Makefile is functional and your README is complete. Then
check again that all your files are enclosed (see above), create a bundle by
entering

$ pwd
[..]/directory-name
$ git bundle create ../comp2811-cw2-$USER.bundle HEAD

Note that in the process, $USER will be substituted with your login name
(please check). now, upload comp2811-cw2-$USER.bundle to VLE/Minerva.

== Inspect your submission (or the example submission)

The command

$ git clone some-file-name.bundle some_directory

creates a clone of the git repository in a subdirectory some_directory. There
you should be able to find a README, as well as follow the instructions in
there.

$ ls some_directory/README
some_directory/README # <= here it is!
